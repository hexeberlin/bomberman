# Bomberman
This is an attempt to recreate a classic game [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) using JavaScript and canvas.

You can play alone, in this case the target is just to find the hidden door on time.
If you play with a friend, you play against each other and can even kill the other character with your bombs.

Developed after the 2nd week in [Ironhack Berlin Coding Camp](https://www.ironhack.com/en/courses/web-development-bootcamp) for WebDev.
